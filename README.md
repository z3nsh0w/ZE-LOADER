# ZE-LOADER

## ZE-LOADER is a multi-source video downloader

### **Project Description**  

This is a **Python-based** project built using **yt-dlp** for video downloading. 
The interface is developed with **Flask** and rendered via **WebView**.

⚠️ This implementation is a **temporary solution**—though as we all know, *"nothing is more permanent than a temporary fix."*  
  - A **major update** is planned, possibly including:  
  - A full rewrite in a more performant language.  
  - A modernized UI framework.
  - And much things more. 

#### **Key Features:**  
- **Cookie support** to bypass download restrictions (e.g., age/region blocks).  
- **Video quality selection** (from 144p to 4K/8K if available).  
- **Download format choice** (MP4, WEBM, audio-only, etc.).  
- **Multi-threaded downloads** for faster fetching.  
- **And all the advanced functionality** you'd expect from premium-grade downloaders.
