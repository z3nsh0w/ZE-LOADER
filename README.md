# ZE LOADER - a video downloader


## ZE LOADER is a tool that lets you easily install videos from any source, in any format and quality.
The app works across all platforms and features a user-friendly design with multiple functions for comfortable usage.


## ðŸš¨ Pre-built multiplatform images are not currently available. The installer and app images will be released tomorrow.


#### **Key Features:**

- **Video quality selection** (from 144p to 4K/8K if available).  
- **Download format choice** (MP4, WEBM, audio-only, etc.).  
- **Multi-threaded downloads** for faster fetching.  
- **And all the advanced functionality** you'd expect from premium-grade downloaders.  



The backend was built using Flask server, with pywebview for the application interface and yt-dlp for video downloading from websites.
